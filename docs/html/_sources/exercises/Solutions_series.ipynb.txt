    "# Measuring Income Equality with the Gini Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in our numpy exercises, one frequently used measure of inequality is the Gini Coefficient. The Gini Coefficient takes on a value of 1 when the distribution of some property is maximally unequal across a said of entities, and a value of 0 when it is evenly distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will calculate the Gini Coefficient for income inequality across the countries of the world to get a sense of not income inequality *within* a country, but rather income inequality *across* countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Gini Coefficient In Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the Gini Coefficient, we plot the cumulative share of the population (ordered from poorest to richest) on the x-axis, and cumulative share of income earned by the cumulative proportion of entities on the y-axis. The Gini Coefficient is then defined as $$\\frac{A}{A + B}$$, where the areas A and B are labeled below: \n",

    "![gini_coefficient](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg/800px-Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If income is evenly distributed, then the poorest 20% of a population will also have 20% of the wealth; the poorest 40% will have 40% of the wealth, and so forth, resulting in a perfect 45 degree line. In this situation, there is no area between the 45% line and the actual income distribution, so $A=0$, and the Gini Coefficient is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, by contrast, the top 10% of people hold all the wealth in a country, then there will be no wealth for the poorest 90% of people, then wealth will jump up at the far right side of the graph. This will generate a very large gap between the 45% line and actual income for most of the graph, generating a large value for the area $A$, creating a very high Gini Coefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is only one of many ways that one can measure inequality, and there is no \"correct\" measure; most of the time we are interested in measuring inequality because we have an ethical concern about inequality itself or because we worry that inequality may give rise to other negative phenomena we care about (e.g., one may worry that economic inequality gives rise to inequality and political influence). Because one may care about inequality for a range of reasons, the \"correct\" measure of the inequality depends entirely on your substantive application! You can learn more about [different measures of inequality here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics). In this case, we are trying to get a general sense of inequality that puts equal weight on inequities at any point in the income distribution, which is what we get with the Gini coefficient. If we were more concerned with just understanding inequality at the very top of the income distribution, we might use a measure [like an income ratio.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_metrics#Share_of_income)\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate what Gini curves look like, here are a few different Gini plots. These come from someone studying inequality of participation, so to adapt this to our study of income, just imagine the y-axis plots share of income):\n",

    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, load data on countries' Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. GDP is a measure of how much is produced by a country's entire economy in a year, and \"per capita\" just means the number has been divided by each country's population, given a measure of the amount of economic production generated per person in a country. Essentially, this is a very crude measure of the wealth of each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that GDP per capita is measured in US dollars (so you can make comparisons across countries), and conversions from local currency to the US dollar were made using [Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) exchange rates (don't worry if that doesn't mean anything to you—just an added detail for any economists reading this).\n",

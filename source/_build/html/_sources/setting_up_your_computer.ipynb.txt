But it is a skill that takes time and energy to learn, and so in most classes — which want to focus on teaching topics like statistical analysis or programming concepts — instructors choose to provide students with clean, ready-to-use environments so everyone can focus on those topics. For example, if the MIDS Python Bootcamp included a module on setting up Python environments instead of providing you with a clean virtual machine, you'd probably end up learning ~25\\% less programming!\n",

In addition, this will give us a chance to learn a little about how the command line works, which will be really important to effective troubleshooting. "

This is necessary because unlike a language like R where you can install packages with the `install.packages()` command, Python doesn't have an internal tool for installing packages. This means that we need a tool like conda if we want to use anything other than vanilla Python (e.g., tools for plotting, numpy, pandas, etc.). \n",

Plus, if we install conda, it will come with pip, so we get the best of both worlds!\n",

It is my **strong** recommendation that you use Miniconda. That's because if you install Anaconda from anaconda.com, you get not only Python and the conda package manager, but also dozens of pre-loaded packages. And while that sounds great, the reality is that it tends to cause lots of package conflicts once you start adding anything new to your installation. Miniconda, as the name implies, is the \"mini\" version of the Anaconda package, and basically only includes Python and a couple core utilities (conda, pip, etc.). As a result, a Miniconda installation is much less likely to cause package conflict problems down the road.\n",

                "**If you already have a conda installation:** My recommendation is to delete it and start fresh. Deleting your Python installation can feel scary once you've set stuff up, but you don't want to get in the practice of being too precious about your Python installations, as you'll often have to just delete it all to deal with software conflicts. \n",

                "   1. When you're asked where to install the software, you want to install it \"For me only,\" not \"Install for all users of this computer.\" *Note that as of July 2021, you may find the \"For me only\" option has a warning saying you can't install there, but if you click a different option then click on the \"For me only\" option again, the warning goes away.*\n",
                "   2. On Windows, you'll be asked if you want to add Miniconda to your PATH variable. Although it recommends that you do not do this, **DO** add it to your PATH. This will be important when we change how our command line works. \n",

To install software for all users, you have to install software at the level of your operating system so it's visible to all users. And your computer is *very* protective of anything installed at the level of the operating system because of the dangers of computer viruses, so anything installed there can run into \"permission\" problems when it tries to run. Anything installed \"for me only\" gets installed in your user folder which your computer is less paranoid about, leading to fewer problems. \n",

When you install packages using conda, conda can actually pull from a number of different package repositories (called \"channels\"). The default for this is the \"anaconda\" channel, but the best channel is actually called [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), so to set that as the default:\n",
